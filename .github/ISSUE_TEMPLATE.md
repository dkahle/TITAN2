## Reproducible Example

You can use this form to report a bug (which we template below) or request a feature. Feel free to delete the templated content and replace with a description of the feature you'd like if this is not a bug.

If you are reporting a bug, please try to provide a [minimal reproducible example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html). The [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package can help you with making such an example, just paste the output here. This helps the maintainers reproduce the bug you encountered. Ensure that the `si` option is `TRUE`.

Example:

```r
reprex::reprex({
    library("TITAN2")
    # your code here
}, si = TRUE)
```
