Description: Uses indicator species scores across binary partitions of
  a sample set to detect congruence in taxon-specific changes of abundance
  and occurrence frequency along an environmental gradient as evidence of
  an ecological community threshold.  Relevant references include: Baker,
  ME and RS King. 2010. A new method for detecting and interpreting
  biodiversity and ecological community thresholds.  Methods in Ecology and
  Evolution 1(1): 25:37. King, RS and ME Baker. 2010. Considerations for
  identifying and interpreting ecological community thresholds.  Journal
  of the North American Benthological Association 29(3):998-1008. Baker ME
  and RS King. 2013. Of TITAN and straw men: an appeal for greater
  understanding of community data. Freshwater Science 32(2):489-506.
