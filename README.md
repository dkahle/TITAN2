**TITAN2** is the second R implementation of Threshold Indicator Taxa
ANalysis. It is an R package source controlled with Git on GitHub and
[distributed on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TITAN2).

To learn more about **TITAN2**, [check out the vignette
here](https://github.com/dkahle/TITAN2/blob/master/vignettes/titan2-intro.pdf)
(you can click Download to view it in a separate window).

*Note: a previous version of this readme stated that you could read the
vignette; however, the vignette is not built when the package is
downloaded from GitHub, so just access it as above.*

## Installation

You can install **TITAN2** in either of two ways. At the present time,
we recommend installing **TITAN2** from GitHub, as it has several new
features, e.g.Â `plot_taxa_ridges()`.

-   From Github (dev version):

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dkahle/TITAN2")
```

-   From CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("TITAN2")
```
